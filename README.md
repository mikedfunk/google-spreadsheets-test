# Example of using Google Spreadsheets API

## Setup

1. Create an app at the [Google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/project)
2. Create a client
3. Enable access to the APIs you need on that client
4. Use [this](https://github.com/asimlqt/php-google-oauth) to get an access token from your client id and client secret
5. copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and change your access token to the one from the step above
6. [get composer](http://getcomposer.org) and `composer install`
7. Load `index.php` in the browser or on the command line
6. The code is just some sample stuff - use [the package
   docs](https://github.com/asimlqt/php-google-spreadsheet-client) along with
   [the google api
   docs](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets) if you need to
   do something different.
